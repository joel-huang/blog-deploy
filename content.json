{"posts":[{"title":"Hello world (again)","text":"I am once again deciding to set up a personal site, domain (while it‚Äôs still available), and blog. I realized I‚Äôve been putting up content on the web as early as 2008/09, and it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had a place to put up my thoughts and work in a more organized manner. I have a feeling it‚Äôll be a mix of thoughts, musings and ideas centered around tech, AI, product, design, entrepreneurship - but I‚Äôm letting this evolve over time and let‚Äôs see where it goes. Hexo wasn‚Äôt that hard to set up, and this theme was beautiful. The comment system from utteranc.es is pretty good, but it‚Äôll bias comments towards GitHub users. I‚Äôll try this out first.","link":"/2024/03/18/hello-world/"}],"tags":[{"name":"meta","slug":"meta","link":"/tags/meta/"}],"categories":[],"pages":[{"title":"Joel Huang","text":"üëæ About meI had a fortunate few years as a curious kid in the late 90s before tech took over. By the turn of the millennium I was running tabletop games at school, building and publishing blog skins, modding handheld games, and running (legally suspect) private servers for friends to experience games in ways they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be able to. I was sure I was going to be a game designer, then a geographer, then an architect‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Increasing technological curiosity had me end up reading CS and AI, where I disovered new tools to make more stuff people love. This part of me will stay. üßë‚Äçüíª Startup lifeI now lead work on AI and product at Bifrost, a Series A startup building 3D virtual worlds as sandboxes for AI. To put it simply, it‚Äôs building photorealistic 3D worlds (√† la Matrix) and having AI systems train within so they learn what to expect, and having them validate those newfound skills in the real world. Startup work is diverse, by choice. I lead an applied AI team that focuses on generative AI, synthetic data, and data-centric computer vision / MLOps. I also play a leading role in product strategy and discovery, prototyping, AI consultancy and solutions engineering, hiring and teambuilding, content strategy, and more good stuff. More about Bifrost Our product goal is to let anyone create 3D worlds easily so they can train and test AI systems properly. This isn't as easy as it sounds, chiefly because: (i) humans are notoriously bad at specification (think how bad we are at *prompting*), (ii) abstraction and control are at odds, (iii) 3D is still a mess, and (iv) AI is difficult to control. Technically, our stack is monstrously complex. To do this, we had to develop expertise across highly fragmented 3D tooling, build AI models, tools, and data engines to generate and test realistic and performant data, and write custom software for orchestration and scale. But at the end of the day, the more wicked the problems, the more value there is in solving them. I‚Äôm fortunate to work alongside brilliant minds who agree, and to be backed by the likes of Sequoia, Wavemaker, Lux, Carbide, and other wonderful investors. üß† Education and workI graduated with a Computer Science degree from Singapore University of Technology and Design, and a master‚Äôs degree in AI from the National University of Singapore. Before Bifrost, I worked on computer vision and machine learning research with orgs like Singtel, Nvidia, and NUS. ‚ú® Other things I enjoyI picked up bouldering more seriously in Sept ‚Äò23, wore out my first pair of shoes in 3 months, and continue to climb ~once a week. In a previous life, I dabbled in music performance, digital music and sound synthesis. Built software for a gesture-control armband to produce music live. Last played keys/synthesizer for BGourd and Spacecrumbs. üì± ContactFor professional matters (talks, workshops, hiring, etc) - You‚Äôre welcome to reach out on LinkedIn or Twitter.
